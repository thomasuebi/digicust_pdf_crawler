The preparation of  LacBuster™-L is  therefore non-toxic, non-hazardous, and non- infectious and does not contain any material from animal origin. Beta-lactamases are  highly specific enzymes which can  be  used for  the  inactivation of  beta- lactam antibiotics for sterility tests and environmental monitoring during the production of beta-lactam antibiotics. To the best of our knowledge there is no secondary use application for beta lactamases according to council regulation EC 428/2009. EUCODIS LacBuster™-L is  intended for  research and quality control purposes only, not  for use in humans.   EB008.1, recombinant microbial beta-lactamase of  microbial origin Identifier CAS  9073-60-3, EC  3.5.2.6   Polypeptide of  beta lactamase, potassium phosphate, sodium Composition chloride, sterile liquid  ,  pH  of  the  solution: 7.0   Non-toxic, non-hazardous, and non-infectious and do  not  contain Hazards Identification any  material from animal origin.

Data Sheet Cat.No. Formulation Sales Unit  Activity/vial Sterile liquid, > 2500 1U Bl EBO008.1 ready-to-use 10x 10 ml > 4000 IU Bll Specifications LacBuster™-L is  a  novel B-lactamase formulation with a broad substrate range against B-lactam antibiotics including carbapenems, cephalosporins up to 5" generation and penicillins. LacBuster™- L is available as a ready-to-use sterile solution. Unit Definition One International unit  of  BI  activity (Penicillinase) will hydrolyze 1.0 pmole benzyipenicillin per minute at pH 7.0 and 25°C. One 1U 6! corresponds to  600 Levy units or  100.000 Kersey Units, respectively. One International unit of ll activity (Cephalosporinase) will hydrolyze 1.0 umole cephalosporin C per minute at pH 7.0 and 25°C. Applications LacBuster™-L can be  applied for  sterility testing of B-lactam antibiotics according to US and European Pharmacopeia. Due to its high activity LacBuster™-L is especially well suited for the direct inoculation method but can be used as well for membrane filtration tests. It can be easily incorporated into existing standard operating procedures by addition of the provided sterile enzyme solution to all buffers and media. To validate complete inactivation of the B-lactam a challenge test (using less than 100 colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 or Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633) with an appropriate quantity of enzyme has to be performed under the custom specific settings. Please refer to our application specialists for further advice. 4 EUCCDIS BIOISCIENCE Further applications include environmental monitoring of manufacturing areas and sterility testing of blood cultures. For preparation of  agar plates, LacBuster™-L is added to the medium at a temperature of s 50°C. Sterility LacBuster™-L vials are filled under aseptic conditions. No growth in Tryptic Soy broth is observed after incubation at 30-35°C for 14 days. Storage/Stability LacBuster™-L is  stable at  2-8°C for  at  least one year from the date of manufacturing. At room temperature (15-25°C) LacBuster™-L is stable for at least one month. Substrate Range LacBuster™-L has been demonstrated to inactivate following B-lactam antibiotics efficiently: Carbapenems: Doripenem, Imipenem, Meropenem Ertapenem, Cephalosporins: Cefaclor, Cefadroxil, Cefazolin, Cefepime, Cefixime, Cefotaxime, Cefoxitin, Cefpodoxime, Ceftazidime, Ceftibuten, Ceftriaxon, Cefuroxime, Cephalexin Penicillins: Amoxicillin, Ampicillin, Benzylpenicillin, Cloxacillin, Nafcillin, Oxacillin, Piperacillin, Ticarcillin For  in  vitro use  only.
